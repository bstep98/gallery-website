							<h2>An Infinite Sky</h2>
							<p>This view was the first thing I thought of when I was given the theme for this photoset. I pass by this view every day on my way to class, and doing it justice was at the forefront of my mind when I photographed it.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/02.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Water Break</h2>
							<p>This piece was a bit hard to capture. I don't have a lot of experience capuring moving subjects. That being said, it took a lot of work to capture this photo, and I'm more than satisfied with the outcome.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/03.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Peeking Through the Trees</h2>
							<p>I wanted this piece to convey a sense of abandonment. I wanted the viewer to feel like they were trapped in the woods, with no idea how they got there, but I wanted there to be an underlying sense of optimism behind that.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/04.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Marking the Land</h2>
							<p>I tried to convey the strength of nature with this piece. I wanted the tree to look like it towered over everything around it, including everything made by man.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/05.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>A Trunk Full of Wonder</h2>
							<p>I was hoping for this piece to feel like somewhat of a journey, like the viewer was as small as an ant, travelling up the trunk of the tree.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/06.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Two Lights</h2>
							<p>This piece should convey the power of nature, showing how what is man-made cannot compare to the sheer majesty and abundance that nature gives us. I wanted the sun almost blind the viewer, with their only refuge being the old lamppost.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/07.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Age and Rebirth</h2>
							<p>Polarity. I wanted this piece to give all who view it a sense of polarity, and how related death and birth can be, sometimes even being adjacent.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/08.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>A Curious Duck 1</h2>
							<p>When I captured this piece, I ran into similar problems that I faced with Water Break. It was hard for me to pose the subject, and I wasn't very keen on getting too close.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/09.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/09.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>A Curious Duck 2</h2>
							<p>Despite my subject's constant movement, I was able to capture this piece and the one prior. It was hard for me to choose between this piece and A Curious Duck 1, so I decided that both deserved to be in this gallery. I hope this duck is proud of me.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/10.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Feng Shui</h2>
							<p>No photo gallery of the Duck Pond would be complete without pictures of the water itself. I wanted this piece to convey the pure size and scope of the Duck Pond, while still showing the beauty of the campus around it.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/11.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/11.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Your Feature Film</h2>
							<p>I actually took two versions of this piece. One where the wood was in focus, and one where the water and the island were in focus. I thought that the pond itself got a good amount of the spotlight in Feng Shui, so I decided showing the beauty and framing of the dock would be a good choice.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/12.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/12.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>A Break By the Water</h2>
							<p>I wanted this piece to be a marriage of Your Feature Film and Feng Shui. I wanted to find a way to balance the water and nature with something man-made, that being the wood. As a send-off for this entire gallery, I think this piece greatly shows the majesty of the nature in Blacksburg.</p>
